"""Political commentary agent for NV Local.

This module defines the political_commentary_agent that finds political figures
and their commentary for a given city. It uses the BaseReActAgent template
with political figure finder, commentary search, and social media tools.

The agent helps voters identify relevant political figures and their publicly
available commentary on local issues. When more context is needed to be fair
and holistic, it can also search their official social media accounts.

Tools are thin adapters that call MCP servers and wrap results in LangGraph Commands.
