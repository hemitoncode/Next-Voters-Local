## 🎯 Features

- **🔍 Intelligent Legislation Discovery** — Autonomous web search for recent municipal legislation with Wikidata-backed source validation
- **📊 Bias-Resistant Analysis** — Five-layer debiasing strategy grounded in academic research (Gallegos et al., 2024; Phute et al., 2023)
- **🗳️ Politician Position Extraction** — Scrapes and analyzes politician statements, press releases, and voting records
- **🛡️ Identity Protection** — Anonymizes politician names before bias analysis, ensuring fair rhetoric evaluation
- **📝 Factual Summaries** — Generates clean, digestible summaries backed by authoritative sources
- **⚙️ Modular Agent System** — Composable ReAct agents with clear separation of concerns
- **🌐 Wikidata Integration** — Validates source reliability using structured knowledge about organizations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.10+
- **OpenAI API Key** (for GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini)
- **Tavily API Key** (for web search)
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemitoncode/Next-Voters-Local.git
   cd Next-Voters-Local
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure API keys**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your OpenAI and Tavily API keys
   ```

5. **Run the system**
   ```bash
   NV_CITY="Austin" python main.py
   ```
   Provide your target municipality either via the `--city` / `-c` flag or by setting `NV_CITY`. The markdown report prints to stdout, `-o <path>` saves it to a file, and `-q` suppresses the printed output.

### 🐳 Container

- Build the updated CLI container:
  ```bash
  docker build -t next-voters-local -f docker/Dockerfile .
  ```
- Run the container with a city override:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -e NV_CITY="Toronto" next-voters-local
  ```
The image executes `main.py` by default, so the pipeline runs automatically and streams the markdown summary to stdout.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Minimal Agency** — ReAct agents only where unpredictable targets or retry loops exist such as during legislative activity discovery phase. Everything else is a deterministic LLM call or pure code.
2. **No Supervision** — Sequential DAG, no supervisor node. Routing is always the same; routing costs would waste API calls.
3. **Judge Isolation** — The Judge never sees real names, never sees graph state. Its narrow scope is its strength.
4. **Source Authority** — Only `.gov`, `.gc.ca`, and Wikidata-validated organizations pass reliability checks. No blogs, no opinion sites, no partisan media.
5. **Cite or Reject** — Every claim must cite its source. Unsupported inferences are rejected.

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Orchestration** | LangChain Expression Language |
| **LLM Provider** | OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini) |
| **LLM Framework** | LangChain 1.1+ |
| **Web Search** | Tavily Search API |
| **Organization Lookup** | Wikidata REST API + SPARQL |
| **Web Scraping** | Generated Python code (REPL sandbox) |
| **NER / Anonymization** | spaCy (or equivalent) |
| **Config** | python-dotenv |
| **HTTP Client** | httpx |

## 🛡️ Bias Resistance

Next Voters Local implements **two core safeguards** against bias:

| Safeguard | Where | Method |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **LLM-as-a-Defense: Name Anonymizer** | Anonymizer (LLM) | Use language model to identify & replace politician names before any analysis |
| **Source Reliability Measure** | Legislation Finder | Validate organizations via Wikidata to ensure only unbiased, authoritative sources are used |

### Implementation

- **Name Anonymization** — All politician identities are removed before rhetoric analysis. This prevents the LLM from making identity-based inferences.
- **Source Validation** — Every source is checked against Wikidata for organizational classification. Only `.gov`, `.gc.ca`, and nonpartisan organizations pass through. No blogs, opinion sites, or politically-aligned media.

### Responsible Use

This system is designed for **informational purposes only**. Users should:
- ✅ Verify claims using the provided source URLs
- ✅ Cross-reference multiple sources before forming opinions
- ✅ Understand this tool supplements, not replaces, civic engagement
- ❌ Not rely on a single summary for critical decisions
